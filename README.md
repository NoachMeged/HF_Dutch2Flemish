## How Dutch2Flemish Works

The workflow for translating HelloFresh recipe content from Dutch to Flemish is designed to be efficient, accurate, and format-preserving. Here's how it works:

1. **Manual Translation to Dutch**  
   - The Dutch team first translates the weekly recipe file from English to Dutch manually.

2. **Automated Flemish Conversion**  
   - The translated Dutch file is then processed using the Python script `Flemishmaker2_0.ipynb`.  
   - The user specifies the location of the file to be translated, and the script automatically handles the conversion using:  
     - A replacement sheet: `Flemishreplacementsheet1.xlsx`  
     - Built-in linguistic rules and nuances for proper Flemish adaptation  
   - The tool preserves formatting including bullet points, bold, italics, and headings, ensuring content is ready for HelloFresh systems.

3. **Formatting Enhancements with BoldAndItalicmaker**  
   - After translation, the text is copied into the `BoldAndItalicmaker` tool.  
   - This tool contains the function `boldAndItalicizeSpecificWords()`, which:  
     - Identifies key phrases such as `"Tip:"`, `"Weetje:"`, `"Gezondheidstip:"` and makes them **bold**, while the rest of the text is italicized.  
     - Detects special phrases like `"(let op: pikant! Gebruik naar smaak)"` and applies **italic formatting**.  
     - Cleans bullet points and ensures vertical text alignment.  
   - The output file is ready to be uploaded directly into the HelloFresh CPS recipe system.

4. **Efficiency and Consistency**  
   - This workflow eliminates manual adaptation of Dutch text to Flemish while preserving all formatting nuances.  
   - Saves approximately **two full days of manual work per recipe week**, ensuring consistent and high-quality content delivery.
