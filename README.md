# HF_Dutch2Flemish
Dutch2Flemish is an efficient, lightweight tool that automatically converts Dutch text into natural Flemish variants. It is specifically designed to address subtle yet important linguistic differences between the Netherlands and Flanders, ensuring content is both locally accurate and contextually authentic.

## How Dutch2Flemish Works

1. **Content Preparation**  
   - Source content is created in English and translated into Dutch.  
   - The text can include recipe instructions, product descriptions, or other types of content.

2. **Automated Conversion**  
   - The Dutch text is processed through **Dutch2Flemish**.  
   - The tool automatically identifies words, phrases, and expressions that differ between standard Dutch and Flemish.  
   - It replaces these with the correct Flemish equivalents while **preserving original formatting** (line breaks, bullet points, headings, etc.).

3. **Output & Integration**  
   - The Flemish text is output in the same structure as the original Dutch text.  
   - The final text can be directly uploaded into your content management system or recipe platform.

4. **Efficiency & Accuracy**  
   - Manual adaptation is no longer necessary, saving approximately **two full days of work per recipe week**.  
   - Ensures consistency and authenticity across all Flemish content.
